## Inspiration
The inspiration behind NutriHub stemmed from the need for an easy-to-use platform that helps individuals track their nutrition and fitness progress. With the increasing importance of personal health and wellness, there was a need to provide users with tools to monitor their nutritional intake and exercise routines in one seamless platform. The goal was to empower users to make healthier choices and reach their fitness goals more effectively.
## What it does
NutriHub allows users to log and track their meals, nutritional intake, and workouts. It provides real-time insights into daily calorie consumption, macronutrient distribution (carbs, protein, fats), and fitness progress.

## How we built it
NutriHub was built using a full-stack JavaScript environment, combining Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend. The backend uses Express for routing, MongoDB for database management, and integrates several services to calculate nutritional data from user inputs. Frontend development leverages React to create an interactive and responsive user interface, ensuring the application is accessible across different devices. The platform also includes middleware for security, error handling, and user authentication.
## Challenges we ran into
We faced several challenges during the development process. One of the most difficult tasks was integrating third-party APIs for accurate nutritional data and ensuring they worked seamlessly with our backend. Additionally, designing a user-friendly interface that balanced functionality with aesthetics was another hurdle, as we wanted the platform to be both intuitive and visually appealing. This was also our first time working with OpenCV. As a result, it was significant learning curve for us to  learn the tool. Lastly, managing state efficiently in the frontend and syncing user data between the frontend and backend in real time proved to be quite a challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of several aspects of NutriHub. First, we successfully integrated real-time nutritional data tracking and developed an intuitive user experience. Our team worked effectively to build both the backend and frontend, and we're especially proud of our user authentication and security mechanisms, which ensure that user data remains safe.

## What we learned
Throughout the development of NutriHub, we learned a great deal about full-stack web development and project management. We gained deeper insights into Node.js and React, especially in terms of managing asynchronous requests and handling API calls. We also learned the importance of user-centric design, ensuring the platform remains accessible to people of all fitness levels. On a broader level, the project taught us the value of teamwork, effective communication, and iterative development to build a product that solves real-world problems.

## What's next for NutriHub
In the future, we plan to expand NutriHub by integrating AI-driven meal and workout recommendations, further personalizing the user experience. We also aim to enhance the social features, enabling users to set up group challenges and competitions. Extended features like integration with wearables (e.g., fitness trackers)  could be achievable, allowing users to automatically sync their activity and health data.
